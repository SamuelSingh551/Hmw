          <h1>Monkeys</h1>
          <p>Monkeys have <b>large brains</b> and are known for their inquisitiveness and intelligence. Brain development, combined with the freeing of the hands and well-developed vision, allows them a great latitude of activity. Most are good at solving complex problems and learning from experience, but they do not quite reach the cognitive levels of great apes. Some, especially the <b>capuchins</b> (genus Cebus), spontaneously use objects as tools (e.g., stones to crack nuts). Others, such as baboons, readily learn to use sticks to obtain food. However, in strong contrast to the great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans), most monkeys do not appear to be very good at learning from each others’ experience—individuals more or less have to learn new behaviours for themselves. A significant exception is the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata). In field experiments, these monkeys were introduced to new foods such as sweet potatoes and candies wrapped in paper. Once a few individuals had solved the problems of getting at the new foods, their innovations gradually spread throughout entire troops. These experiments have had implications in redefining cultural behaviour.</p>
          <h1>Are They Social?</h1>
          <p>Monkeys are <b>highly social</b> animals, and almost all live in troops consisting of several females with young and either a single male (as in hamadryas baboons, mandrills, most guenons, and most langurs) or several males (as in savannah baboons and macaques). Usually, but not universally, the females stay in the troop in which they were born and are thus closely related to each other. Males join new troops on maturity, and so they are unrelated to each other and somewhat antagonistic. Like humans and apes, female monkeys nurse their young and have a menstrual cycle, albeit less copious. In some species, sexual activity is strictly confined to the period around ovulation (estrus); in others, there appears to be little or no restriction. Some species breed all year round; others have a period several months long during which they experience no sexual cycles (anestrus).</p>
          <h1>The New World</h1>
          <p>New World monkeys live primarily in tropical <b>South America, especially the Amazon rainforests; the range of a few species extends northward as far as southern Mexico or southward into northern Argentina.</b> Among the smaller New World forms that have endeared themselves to humans with their antics and their tamability are the alert marmosets, often tufted and colourfully arrayed, and the inquisitive squirrel, woolly, and capuchin monkeys—all of which exhibit in marked degree the curiosity and cleverness ascribed to monkeys generally. Larger New World species include the acrobatic spider monkeys and the noisy howlers. Other New World monkeys include uakaris, sakis, and titis.</p>

          <h1>The Old World</h1>
          <p>Old World monkeys live throughout <b>Africa, on the Red Sea coast of Arabia, and in Asia from Afghanistan to Japan and southeast to the islands of the Philippines, Celebes, Bacan, and Timor.</b> Some Old World monkeys have been successfully naturalized in Gibraltar, France, Mauritius, Belau, and a few islands of the West Indies. Old World monkeys include many that are often seen in zoos, especially the beautifully coloured African guenons (e.g., mona, diana, white-nosed, green, vervet, and grivet monkeys), colobus, mangabeys, and the chiefly Asiatic macaques. The macaques include the Barbary “ape” of North Africa and the Rock of Gibraltar—the only macaque outside Asia and the only wild monkey inhabiting any part of Europe today—and the rhesus monkey of the Indian subcontinent, which has been used considerably in medical research. The graceful langurs include the hanuman, or sacred monkey, also of southern Asia. Among the more unusual monkeys are the large and strikingly coloured African drills and mandrills, the proboscis monkey of Borneo, and the rare and bizarre snub-nosed monkeys of China and Vietnam. The Old World monkeys are divided into two subfamilies: Cercopithecinae and Colobinae. The cercopithecines have cheek pouches, in which they store food; these include baboons, macaques, guenons, and their relatives. The colobines lack cheek pouches but have complicated three- or four-chambered stomachs, where bacterial fermentation of cellulose and hemicellulose occurs and thereby enriches the nutrient content of their diet, which consists partially of leaves and seeds. Colobines include colobus monkeys, langurs, and their relatives.</p>
